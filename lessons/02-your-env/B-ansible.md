## Ansible
Now a long running way I have been using to manage my dotfiles have been
exclusively through ansible.  There are several pluses to managing through
ansible and there are some negatives

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Pros
* there is tons of online documentation
* its used more than just managing dotfiles
* ansible vault allows for plain storage of ssh keys!  which is really cool
* you can also store a bunch of other cool stuff with ansible vault (think auth passcodes)

## Cons
* it can be terribly slow
* it can be hard to make it work for certain tasks, such as installing neovim
  plugins
* tags can be great and super annoying
* yaml sucks

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Basic Ansible
lets create a simple ansible script to clone neovim from source and build it
from a specific tagged version

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## What is ansible?
From their github <br>
> Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on the Ansible website.

You are probably thinking... wait... aren't we talking about dotfiles and environments?

<br>
<br>

Why yes we are!

<br>
<br>

This is a tool designed for "servers" and if you squint your eyes you will
realize that you are just working on a "server."

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Install ansible
as all adventures start...

```
pip3 install ansible
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The heart of ansible
Typically when you are working with ansible you are using an inventory, which
is a list of all servers you have proper access to, and a series of playbooks.
The playbooks are where we specify the tasks we wish to perform on one or more
nodes (machines).  The playbook is the heart of ansible

<br>
<br>

As a friend once said
> ansible is the helicopter that drops godzilla
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
> ... godzilla being k8s

<br>
<br>

Since we are operating on our own machine we wont need the inventory part, its
just `localhost`

<br>
<br>

Lets just jump right into the playbook side of ansible which is where all the
work is done

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Your First Playbook
Lets start off by creating a playbook that will use git to download the
contents of neovim to a directory in a directory of our choosing

* create a new directory, lets call it `mfansible`
* create a file called `neovim.yml`
* input the following

```yml
- name: My first playbook
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
```

with this alone we can now execute ansible and see the effects

```
ansible-playbook neovim.yml
```

and you should see output that is similar to

```
➜  ansible-neovim-example git:(master) ✗ ansible-playbook neovim.yml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [The Great Neovim editor] *****************************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *************************************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Congrats!
you have ran your first ansible script!

Lets do some git

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Lets clone down neovim!
When it comes to using ansible, one of my favorite features is the docs and how
they are organized.  it just makes it so simple to google and get the exact
answer out you need.  ChatGPT is nice to use, but can sometimes lead you into
too much usage of odd features like scripting

* Google ansible git clone
* scroll the documentation and copy the one they suggest
* perhaps combine a few to make this most efficient!

<br>
<br>

But where do we put the code we find?  Well... remember that empty `tasks` key?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Expected Task Output


```yaml
- name: My first playbook
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Git neovim
    ansible.builtin.git:
      repo: "https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git"
      dest: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'HOME') }}/personal/neovim"
      version: v0.10.2
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Become familiar with the build first
there will be several libs that you may require to get this working so to do
this correctly you will first want to build neovim by hand and keep track of
the libraries that you need.  There is likely a list of requirements in the
[BUILD.md](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md)

### Making neovim requires packages
Here are the packages i needed to install from apt to get neovim

```bash
sudo apt install cmake gettext lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev
```

### Lets get the libraries first
Lets translate what I installed into an ansible command.

* google how to ansible apt
* copy the proper command

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Expected Code
Your code should look something like this

```yaml
- name: My first playbook
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Git neovim
    ansible.builtin.git:
      repo: "https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git"
      dest: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'HOME') }}/personal/neovim"
      version: v0.10.2

  - name: Install helping libs
    become: true
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      pkg:
      - lua5.1
      - liblua5.1-0-dev
      - cmake
      - gettext
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## OH NO! Crash!
If you are using apt and have to use sudo you should see the following error.

```

}
```

Well ansible does have the ability to become the sudo but it needs the creds to
do it, you can type in those creds before installing by using the -K flag

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Now build!
Now all we have to build neovim and then sudo make install!  We do the same
process

* google make
* copy the relevant instructions
* implement the new tasks
* ...
* neovim (which is profit)!

### To make neovim (from BUILD.md)
The command to run to make neovim is the following:

```bash
cd neovim && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```

then to install it we need to execute

```bash
sudo make install
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Expected output
```yaml
- name: My first playbook
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Git neovim
    ansible.builtin.git:
      repo: "https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git"
      dest: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'HOME') }}/personal/neovim"
      version: v0.9.4

  - name: Install helping libs
    become: true
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      pkg:
      - lua5.1
      - liblua5.1-0-dev
      - cmake
      - gettext

  - name: neovim
    make:
      chdir: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'HOME') }}/personal/neovim"
      params:
        CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: "RelWithDebInfo"

  - name: neovim install
    become: true
    make:
      target: install
      chdir: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'HOME') }}/personal/neovim"
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## And that is ansible
that is what it takes to create neovim ansible.

<br>
<br>

### Why would i use this over a bash script
A bash script is great when you can execute it on a machine, but ansible allows
you to execute all these operations on a bunch of host machines at once, your
machine, uniform syntax (yml).  It also allows for some custom logic based on
operating system so you could interchange out the fetching mechanism to make it
machine independent

<br>
<br>

Ansible can be real great.  It "seems" easier to maintain than having a bunch
of bash scripts for each operating system.  It can also make automating your
setup a bit easier.

<br>
<br>

But for me... its a no at this point.  I prefer a single script that i control
+ some basic convention.  Convention over configuration is a mantra i support
